## There are 3 scripts in this directory for searching and renaming files

### 1_searching_for_file.py

This script will search the directory for all files for a specific file type and put the results
of the files in a text file

### 2_copy_files_to_directory.py

This script will copy all files in the text file from 1_searching_for_file.py script
and copy all the files that were found and dump them into the output folder.

### 3_rename_files_in_directory.py

This script will rename all files in the output folder to the desired prefix and add a number to each file
by enumerating through the files.
