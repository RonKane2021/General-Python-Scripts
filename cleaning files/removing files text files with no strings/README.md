### Copying only text files with strings in them

This program looks for any strings in text files. The files with strings will be copied to the dest folder and if no words are found then the file is displayed on the python shell. It can be used only keep text files with content inside them.

## Example

I have 6 text files(1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt, 4.txt, 5.txt, 6.txt) in a directory and only 5.txt has a string inside the text file. Only 5.txt will be copied to the destination folder and the other results will be pasted onto the python shell.


These Files do not have any words in their document!

1.txt

2.txt

3.txt

4.txt.

6.txt
