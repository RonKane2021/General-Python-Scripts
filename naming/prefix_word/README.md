This script is for generating a number series while having a prefix you want to add on before the numbered list.

For example: 

I have the prefix: ABC000 and I want to generate a list of 20 numbers with that prefix starting with 0.

Output:

'ABC0000, ABC0001, ABC0002, ABC0003, ABC0004, ABC0005, ABC0006, ABC0007, ABC0008, ABC0009, ABC0010, ABC0011, ABC0012, ABC0013, ABC0014, ABC0015, ABC0016, ABC0017, ABC0018, ABC0019, ABC0020'
